<p>With the sharpen, we add the original image and we apply the sharpen making the image looking sharper. We can increase or decrease the value of the sharpen section by click to the up arrow or down arrow. When we click to the up arrow, the image will be more sharp. If we click to the down arrow, the image will be less sharp.</p>

    <p>With the Gray Scale, we add the original image and we click to the Apply. Then, the original image will turn to the gray color. With the Gray Scale, it only has the gray color. We can not increase or decrease the color.</p>
    <p>With the Edges, we add the original image and we apply the Filter Edge, it will make the original image become darker. We can adjust the number on the function to make the original image become darker or become less darker.</p>
    <p>With the Quantize, when we add the original image and we decreased the value of the quantize, it will make the image turning brighter than the original image. We also change the color of the image by increasing or decreasing the value in the quantize Filter function. At that time, we can have the color of the image that we want to be.</p>
