		<h2>Senior Project </h2>

		<p> For this semester, we did the Paint programming which including three parts such as Iteration 1, Iteration 2 and Iteration 3. This project was so difficult, but it was interesting for us. It seemed a challenge for students but the students wanted to conquer this project. </p>
		<p> For the paint programming, we had to use the

			class, we used C++ language to write for this project.

		<h2>Introduction about the Iteration 3</h2>
		<p>The Iteration 3 included five parts such as library.a, Mia Graphic, Mia Command Line, Testing and Website. 
		For Mia Graphic, we had to load the Medical images in the brainstack folder. We used tools in the Paint programming to adjust the pictures. We could use some tools to adust the image such as Blur, Saturation, Gray Scale, Threshold, Multiple RGB and so on. When we loaded the images, we could draw something on it by using Pen tool..</p>
